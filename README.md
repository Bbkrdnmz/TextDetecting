# TextDetecting
In this project, I used Keras OCR and Tesseract OCR to detect and identify the texts on the images. With the help of Tesseract, I asked it to find the English equivalents of the texts in the images.
As you can see on the dataset, since I made the default language English, it also made predictions in English for Arabic or other languages in the images. 
The dataset I used contains about 7000 photos, image taggers and parquet files holding metadata, you can access the dataset here:
